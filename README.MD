Project Summary: Movie Recommendation System
Objective:
To build a movie recommendation system that leverages user ratings, movie genres, and tags to provide insights into movie popularity and user preferences.

Steps Taken:
Data Loading:

Loaded datasets containing movies, ratings, and tags using Pandas.
Data Cleaning:

Converted timestamp columns in the ratings and tags datasets to a datetime format.
Ensured data integrity and identified any potential issues in the datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Genre Distribution: Analyzed and visualized the distribution of movie genres using a bar chart.
Ratings Distribution: Examined the distribution of ratings using a histogram.
Top Rated Movies: Identified and displayed the top 10 movies based on average ratings.
Tag Analysis: Analyzed and visualized the most commonly used tags in the tags dataset.
Feature Engineering:

Created features such as average ratings per user and total ratings per movie.
Encoded movie genres into multiple columns for further analysis.
Correlation Analysis:

Generated a correlation matrix to explore relationships between movie genres and average ratings, visualized using a heatmap.
A/B Testing:

Split the ratings dataset into two groups to compare average ratings between them.
Results Saving:

Saved processed datasets, including a new DataFrame with encoded genres and average ratings, and average ratings per user.
Future Recommendations:

Discussed potential improvements to the recommendation system, such as implementing collaborative filtering or content-based filtering methods to suggest movies based on user preferences and behavior.
Key Insights:
The analysis revealed the most popular genres and tags, along with the top-rated movies, providing a foundation for recommending films.
The correlation analysis highlighted relationships between genres and ratings, which could help tailor recommendations.
The A/B testing offered insights into user preferences, aiding in the refinement of the recommendation algorithm.
Potential Enhancements:
Implementing machine learning models (like collaborative filtering) for personalized recommendations.
Integrating user demographic data for improved prediction accuracy.
Enhancing user interface features to allow users to explore movies and recommendations interactively.
